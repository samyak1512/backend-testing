create a signin route and use otp verification

create a login route

create and use a mongodb database`









in signup page:
there will be name, email, password and confirmPassword fields.
After that user will click signup. If there is any error is the info then it is shown then & there.
Else the user will have to type in otp.
if otp matches then an entry in the database is created.


how signup works:
1.) post sendOtp request => if okay then otp sent
2.) post check-otp request => if okay then signup request sent
3.) signup will create an entry in the database

LOGS
##  The basic backend is complete with login route.
##  The signup page with otp is working fine.
##  The @gradio/client does not have a CommonJS module so I had to change the JS format of the complete project from CommonJS to ES Module.
##  The ML Model API is integrated successfully.
